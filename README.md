# Rustball

Dicebot coded in Rust. Readme under construction, as is the bot itself. Currently a discord bot, but written to be adaptable to other platforms.

## Using Sixball

As the bot is under development, there is no invite link and the application is not public. This is a personal project and not really meant for wide-scale use. If for some reason you want to use it anyway, contact me directly to work something out. Or you can clone the repo and build your own.

## Features

TBA

### Rolling Dice (The Main Show)

Use the commands in the Dice group to roll dice. Sixball is built around one main roll command that accepts syntax to manipulate dice at a low level and game-specific commands which take symplified syntax specialized to their system and translate that to the more complex roll syntax under the hood. For a full explanation of the roll syntax (both general and specific), go to

**[The Roll Syntax Documentation](/ROLLSYNTAX.md)**

## Contact

Realistically, if you're reading this at all, you probably know me personally and can reach me wherever you normally reach me. Otherwise, the best way to get my attention is probably to raise an issue.
